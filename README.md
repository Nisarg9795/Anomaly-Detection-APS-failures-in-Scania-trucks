# Anomaly-Detection-APS-failures-in-Scania-trucks
Predict failure of a component in the APS system which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The positive class represents a specific component failure and the negative class represents failures not related to the APS. In this dataset, cost for wrongly classified positive class and cost for wrongly classified negative class is given and we need to optimize this cost while prediction.  Five different kinds of models were built: Random Forest, k-NN, Gaussian, Logistic regression and SVM. Each used different data manipulation techniques like synthetic oversampling, replacing values with mean or median etc. and feature reduction techniques like PCA, Z-score, etc. The models were given weights according to the cost that was obtained and the later a decision was made according to them.
